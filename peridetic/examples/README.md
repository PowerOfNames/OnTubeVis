# Peridetic - Examples

This directory contains a couple programs that use the Peridetic
transformations. They are offered to provide working usage example for
general reference - as well as source material for (doxygen) document
generation.

Each program may be run with no arguments to obtain a simple usage
message.

Note that argument values are interpreted in standard units (i.e. *meters*
for linear values, and *radians* for angular ones).

### lpaForXyz

Compute and report Geodetic coordinate values (longitude, parallel,
altitude) from provided argument values interpreted as Cartesian ("X",
"Y", "Z") coordinates.

### xyzForLpa

Compute and report Cartesian ("X", "Y", "Z") coordinate values for
argument values representing Geodetic (longitude, parallel, altitude)
values.
